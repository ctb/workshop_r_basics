## Nick's Acknowledgements

Sincere thanks to:

Duncan Temple Lang, whose guidance and encouragement has had outsize influence
on the way I think about and teach data science.

Deb Nolan, for being a role model as a data scientist, educator, and academic.
Special thanks for the opportunity to collaborate on STAT 33 (on which this
reader and workshop is loosely based) at Cal.

Last but not least, every former student that asked questions or offered
feedback when I taught.
