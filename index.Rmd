# Overview {-}

This 4-part workshop series provides an introduction to using the R programming
language for reproducible data analysis and scientific computing. Topics
include programming basics, how to work with tabular data, how to break down
programming problems, and how to organize code for clarity and reproducibility.

After this workshop, learners will be able to load tabular data sets into R,
compute simple summaries and visualizations, do common data-tidying tasks,
write reusable functions, and identify where to go to learn more.

No prior programming experience is necessary. All learners will need access to
an internet-connected computer and the latest version of Zoom, R, and RStudio.
