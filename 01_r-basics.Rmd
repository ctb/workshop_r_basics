Getting Started
===============

R is a program for statistical computing. It provides a rich set of built-in
tools for cleaning, exploring, modeling, and visualizing data.

The main way you'll interact with R is by writing code or _expressions_ in the
R programming language. Most people use "R" as a blanket term to refer to both
the program and the programming language. Usually, the distinction doesn't
matter, but in cases where it does, we'll point it out and be specific.

By writing code, you create an unambiguous record of every step taken in an
analysis. This it one of the major advantages of R (and other programming
languages) over point-and-click software like Tableau and Microsoft Excel.
Code you write in R is *reproducible*: you can share it with someone else, and
if they run it with the same inputs, they'll get the same results.

Another advantage of writing code is that it's often *reusable*. This can mean
automating a repetitive task within a single analysis, recycling code from one
analysis into another, or _packaging_ useful code for distribution to the
general public. At the time of writing, there were over 17,000 user-contributed
packages available for R, spanning a broad range of disciplines.

R is one of many programming languages used in data science. Compared to other
programming languages, R's particular strengths are its interactivity, built-in
support for handling missing data, the ease with which you can produce
high-quality data visualizations, and its broad base of user-contributed
packages (due to both its age and growing popularity).


Prerequisites
-------------

<img src="img/rlogo.png" width="10%">

You can download R for free [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/), and can find
an install guide [here]().

In addition to R, you'll need RStudio. RStudio is an *integrated development
environment* (IDE), which means it's a comprehensive program for writing,
editing, searching, and running code. You can do all of these things without
RStudio, but RStudio makes the process easier. You can download RStudio Desktop
Open-Source Edition for free
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and can find an
install guide [here]().


The R Interface
---------------

The first time you open RStudio, you'll see a window divided into several
panes, like this:

<img src="img/rstudio_start.png">

Don't worry if the text in the panes isn't exactly the same on your computer;
it depends on your operating system and versions of R and RStudio. The console
pane, on the left, is the main interface to R. If you type R code into the
console and press the `Enter` key on your keyboard, R will run your code and
return the result.

On the right are the environment pane and the plots pane. The environment pane
shows data in your R workspace. The plots pane shows any plots you make, and
also has tabs to browse your file system and to view R's built-in help files.
We'll learn more about these gradually, but to get started we'll focus on the
console pane.

Let's start by using R to do some arithmetic. In the console, you'll see that
the cursor is on a line that begins with `>`, called the *prompt*. You can make
R compute the sum $2 + 2$ by typing the code `2 + 2` after the prompt and then
pressing the `Enter` key. Your code and the result from R should look like
this:

<img src="img/arithmetic.png">

R always puts the result on a separate line (or lines) from your code. In this
case, the result begins with the tag `[1]`, which is a hint from R that the
result is a *vector* and that this line starts with the *element* at position 1.
We'll learn more about vectors in Section \@ref(vectors), and eventually learn
about other data types that are displayed differently. The result of the sum,
`4`, is displayed after the tag. In this reader, results from R will usually be
typeset in monospace and further prefixed with `##` to indicate that they
aren't code.

If you enter an incomplete expression, R will change the prompt to `+`, then
wait for you to type the rest of the expression and press the `Enter` key.
Here's what it looks like if you only enter `2 +`:

<img src="img/incomplete.png">

You can finish entering the expression, or you can cancel it by pressing the
`Esc` key (or `Ctrl-c` if you're using R without RStudio). R can only tell an
expression is incomplete if it's missing something, like the second operand in
`2 +`. So if you mean to enter `2 + 2` but accidentally enter `2`, which is a
complete expression by itself, don't expect R to read your mind and wait for
more input!

Try out some other arithmetic in the R console. Besides `+` for addition, the
other arithmetic operators are:

* `-` for subtraction
* `*` for multiplication
* `/` for division
* `%%` for remainder division (modulo)
* `^` or `**` for exponentiation

You can combine these and use parentheses to make more complicated expressions,
just as you would when writing a mathematical expression. When R computes a
result, it follows the standard order of operations: parentheses,
exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, and finally subtraction.
For example, to estimate the area of a circle with radius 3, you can write:

```{r}
3.14 * 3^2
```

You can write R expressions with any number of spaces (including none) around
the operators and R will still compute the result. Nevertheless, putting spaces
in your code makes it easier for you and others to read, so it's good to make
it a habit. Put spaces around most operators, after commas, and after keywords.

### Variables

Since R is designed for mathematics and statistics, you might expect that it
provides a better appoximation for $\pi$ than `3.14`. R and most other
programming languages allow you to create named values, or _variables_. R
provides a built-in variable called `pi` for the value of $\pi$. You can
display a variable's value by entering its name in the console:

```{r}
pi
```

You can also use variables in expressions. For instance, here's a more precise
expression for the area of a circle with radius 3:

```{r}
pi * 3^2
```

You can define your own variables with the assignment operator `=` or `<-`. In
most circumstances these two operators are interchangeable. For clarity, it's
best to choose one you like and use it consistently in all of your R code. In
this reader, we use `=` for assignment because this is the assignment operator
in most programming languages.

The main reason to use variables is to save results so that you can use them
on other expressions later. For example, to save the area of the circle in a
variable called `area`, we can write:

```{r}
area = pi * 3^2
```

In R, variable names can contain any combination of letters, numbers, dots `.`,
and underscores `_`, but must always start with a letter or a dot. Spaces and
other symbols are not allowed in variable names.

Now we can use the `area` variable anywhere we want the computed area. Notice
that when you assign a result to a variable, R doesn't automatically display
that result. If you want to see the result as well, you have to enter the
variable's name as a separate expression:

```{r}
area
```

Another reason to use variables is to make an expression more general. For
instance, you might want to compute the area of several circles with different
radii. Then the expression `pi * 3^2` is too specific. You can rewrite it as
`pi * r^2`, and then assign a value to the variable `r` just before you compute
the area. Here's the code to compute and display the area of a circle with
radius 1 this way:

```{r}
r = 1
area = pi * r^2
area
```

Now if you want to compute the area for a different radius, all you have to do
is change `r` and run the code again (R will not change `area` until you do
this). Writing code that's general enough to reuse across multiple problems can
be a big time-saver in the long run. Later on, we'll see ways to make this code
even easier to reuse.

### Calling Functions

R can do a lot more than just arithmetic. Most of R's features are provided
through _functions_, pieces of reusable code. You can think of a function as a
machine that takes some inputs and uses them to produce some output. In
programming jargon, the inputs to a function are called _arguments_, the output
is called the _return value_, and when we use a function, we say we're
_calling_ the function.

To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses. Put any arguments
to the function inside the parentheses. For example, in R, the sine function is
named `sin` (there are also `cos` and `tan`). So we can compute the sine of
$\pi / 4$ with this code:

```{r}
sin(pi / 4)
```

There are many functions that accept more than one argument. For instance, the
`sum` function accepts any number of arguments and adds them all together. When
you call a function with multiple arguments, separate the arguments with
commas. So another way to compute $2 + 2$ in R is:

```{r}
sum(2, 2)
```

When you call a function, R assigns each argument to a _parameter_. Parameters
are special variables that represent the inputs to a function and only exist
while that function runs. For example, the `log` function, which computes a
logarithm, has parameters `x` and `base` for the operand and base of the
logaritm, respectively. The next section, Section \@ref(getting-help), explains
how to look up the parameters for a function.

By default, R assigns arguments to parameters based on their order. The first
argument is assigned to the function's first parameter, the second to the
second, and so on. So we can compute the logarithm of 64, base 2, with this
code:

```{r}
log(64, 2)
```

The argument 64 is assigned to the parameter `x`, and the argument 2 is
assigned to the parameter `base`. You can also assign arguments to parameters
by name with `=` (not `<-`), overriding their positions. So some other ways we
could write the call above are:

```{r}
log(64, base = 2)
log(x = 64, base = 2)
log(base = 2, x = 64)
log(base = 2, 64)
```

All of these are equivalent. When you write code, choose whatever seems the
clearest to you. Leaving parameter names out of calls saves typing, but
including some or all of them can make the code easier to understand.

Parameters are not regular variables, and only exist while their associated
function runs. You can't set them before a call, nor can you access them after
a call. So this code causes an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x = 64
log(base = 2)
```

In the error message, R says that we forgot to assign an argument to the
parameter `x`. We can keep the variable `x` and correct the call by making `x`
an argument (for the parameter `x`):

```{r}
log(x, base = 2)
```

Or, written more explicitly:

```{r}
log(x = x, base = 2)
```

In summary, variables and parameters are distinct, even if they happen to have
the same name. The variable `x` is not the same thing as the parameter `x`.


Getting Help
------------

Learning and using a language is hard, so it's important to know how to get
help. The first place to look for help is R's built-in documentation. In the
console, you can access a specific help page by name with `?` followed by the
name of the page.

There are help pages for all of R's built-in functions, usually with the same
name as the function itself. So the code to open the help page for the `log`
function is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log
```

For functions, help pages usually include a brief description, a list of
parameters, a description of the return value, and some examples.

There are also help pages for other topics, such as built-in mathematical
constants (such as `?pi`), data sets (such as `?iris`), and operators. To look
up the help page for an operator, put the operator's name in single or double
quotes. For example, this code opens the help page for the arithmetic
operators:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?"+"
```

It's always okay to put quotes around the name of the page when you use `?`,
but they're only required if it contains non-alphabetic characters. So `?sqrt`,
`?'sqrt'`, and `?"sqrt"` all open the documentation for `sqrt`, the square root
function.

R treats anything inside single or double quotes as literal text rather than as
an expression to evaluate. In programming jargon, a piece of literal text is
called a _string_. You can use whichever kind of quotes you prefer, but the
quote at the beginning of the string must match the quote at the end. 

Sometimes you might not know the name of the help page you want to look up. You
can do a general search of R's help pages with `??` followed by a string of
search terms. For example, to get a list of all help pages related to linear
models:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
??"linear model"
```

This search function doesn't always work well, and it's often more efficient to
use an online search engine. When you search for help with R online, include
"R" as a search term. Alternatively, you can use [RSeek][rseek], which
restricts the search to a selection of R-related websites.

### When Something Goes Wrong

As a programmer, sooner or later you'll run some code and get an error message
or result you didn't expect. Don't panic! Even experienced programmers make
mistakes regularly, so learning how to diagnose and fix problems is vital.

Try going through these steps:

1. If R returned a warning or error message, read it! If you're not sure what
   the message means, try searching for it online.
2. Check your code for typographical errors, including incorrect capitalization
   and missing or extra commas, quotes, and parentheses.
3. Test your code one line at a time, starting from the beginning. After each
   line that assigns a variable, check that the value of the variable is what
   you expect. Try to determine the exact line where the problem originates
   (which may differ from the line that emits an error!).

If none of these steps help, try asking online. [Stack Overflow][stacko] is a
popular question and answer website for programmers. Before posting, make sure
to read about [how to ask a good question][goodq].

File Systems
------------

Most of the time, you won't just write code directly into the R console.
Reproducibility and reusability are important benefits of R over
point-and-click software, and in order to realize these, you have to save your
code to your computer's hard drive. Let's start by reviewing how files on a
computer work. You'll need to understand that before you can save your code,
and it will also be important later on for loading data sets.

Your computer's _file system_ is a collection of _files_ (chunks of data) and
_directories_ (or "folders") that organize those files. For instance, the file
system on a computer shared by [Ada][ada] and [Charles][chuck], two pioneers of
computing, might look like this:

[ada]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace
[chuck]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage

<img src="img/filesystem.png" width="50%">

Don't worry if your file system looks a bit different from the picture.

File systems have a tree-like structure, with a top-level directory called the
_root directory_. On Ada and Charles' computer, the root is called `/`, which
is also what it's called on all macOS and Linux computers. On Windows, the root
is usually called `C:/`, but sometimes other letters, like `D:/`, are also used
depending on the computer's hardware.

A _path_ is a list of directories that leads to a specific file or directory on
a file system (imagine giving directons to someone as they walk through the
file system). We use forward slashes `/` to separate the directories in a path,
rather than commas or spaces. The root directory includes a forward slash as
part of its name, and doesn't need an extra one.

For example, suppose Ada wants to write a path to the file `cats.csv`. She can
write the path like this:

```
/Users/ada/cats.csv
```

You can read this path from left-to-right as, "Starting from the root
directory, go to the `Users` directory, then from there go to the `ada`
directory, and from there go to the file `cats.csv`." Alternatively, you can
read the path from right-to-left as, "The file `cats.csv` inside of the `ada`
directory, which is inside of the `Users` directory, which is in the root
directory."

As another example, suppose Charles wants a path to the `Programs` directory.
He can write:

```
/Programs/
```

The `/` at the end of this path is reminder that `Programs` is a directory, not
a file. Charles could also write the path like this:

```
/Programs
```

This is still correct, but it's not as obvious that `Programs` is a directory.
In other words, when a path leads to a directory, including a _trailing slash_
is optional, but makes the meaning of the path clearer. Paths that lead to
files never have a trailing slash.

On Windows computers, paths are usually written with backslashes ```\``` to
separate directories instead of forward slashes. Fortunately, R uses forward
slashes `/` for all paths, regardless of the operating system. So when you're
working in R, use forward slashes and don't worry about the operating system.
This is especially convenient when you want to share code with someone that
uses a different operating system than you.

### Absolute & Relative Paths

A path that starts from the root directory, like all of the ones we've seen so
far, is called an _absolute path_. The path is "absolute" because it
unambiguously describes where a file or directory is located. The downside is
that absolute paths usually don't work well if you share your code.

For example, suppose Ada uses the path `/Programs/ada/cats.csv` to load the
`cats.csv` file in her code. If she shares her code with another pioneer of
computing, say [Gladys][gladys], who also has a copy of `cats.csv`, it might
not work. Even though Gladys has the file, she might not have it in a directory
called `ada`, and might not even have a directory called `ada` on her computer.
Because Ada used an absolute path, her code works on her own computer, but
isn't portable to others.

[gladys]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_West

On the other hand, a _relative path_ is one that doesn't start from the root
directory. The path is "relative" to an unspecified starting point, which
usually depends on the context.

For instance, suppose Ada's code is saved in the file `analysis.R` (more about
`.R` files in Section \@ref(r-scripts)), which is in the same directory as
`cats.csv` on her computer. Then instead of an absolute path, she can use a
relative path in her code:

```
cats.csv
```

The context is the location of `analysis.R`, the file that contains the code.
In other words, the starting point on Ada's computer is the `ada` directory. On
other computers, the starting point will be different, depending on where the
code is stored.

Now suppose Ada sends her corrected code in `analysis.R` to Gladys, and tells
Gladys to put it in the same directory as `cats.csv`. Since the path `cats.csv`
is relative, the code will still work on Gladys' computer, as long as the two
files are in the same directory. The name of that directory and its location in
the file system don't matter, and don't have to be the same as on Ada's
computer. Gladys can put the files in a directory `/Users/gladys/from_ada/` and
the path (and code) will still work.

Relative paths can include directories. For example, suppose that Charles wants
to write a relative path from the `Users` directory to a cool selfie he took.
Then he can write:

```
charles/cool_hair_selfie.jpg
```

You can read this path as, "Starting from wherever you are, go to the `charles`
directory, and from there go to the `cool_hair_selfie.jpg` file." In other
words, the relative path depends on the context of the code or program that
uses it.

When use you paths in R code, they should almost always be relative paths. This
ensures that the code is portable to other computers, which is an important
aspect of reproducibility. Another benefit is that relative paths tend to be
shorter, making your code easier to read (and write).

When you write paths, there are three shortcuts you can use. These are most
useful in relative paths, but also work in absolute paths:

* `.` means the current directory.
* `..` means the directory above the current directory.
* `~` means the _home directory_. Each user has their own home directory, whose
  location depends on the operating system and their username. Home directories
  are typically found inside `C:/Users/` on Windows, `/Users/` on macOS, and
  `/home/` on Linux.

As an example, suppose Ada wants to write a (relative) path from the `ada`
directory to Charles' cool selfie. Using these shorcuts, she can write:

```
../charles/cool_hair_selfie.jpg
```

Read this as, "Starting from wherever you are, go up one directory, then go to
the `charles` directory, and then go to the `cool_hair_selfie.jpg` file." Since
`/Users/ada` is Ada's home directory, she could also write the path as:

```
~/../charles/cool_hair_selfie.jpg
```

This path has the same effect, but the meaning is slightly different. You can
read it as "Starting from your home directory, go up one directory, then go to
the `charles` directory, and then go to the `cool_hair_selfie.jpg` file."

The `..` and `~` shortcut are frequently used and worth remembering. The `.`
shortcut is included here in case you see it in someone else's code. Since it
means the current directory, a path like `./cats.csv` is identical to
`cats.csv`, and the latter is preferable for being simpler. There are a few
specific situations where `.` is necessary, but they fall outside the scope of
this text.


### R Scripts

Now that you know how file systems and paths work, you're ready to learn how to
save your R code to a file. R code is usually saved into an _R script_
(extension `.R`) or an _R Markdown file_ (extension `.Rmd`). R scripts are
slightly simpler, so let's focus on those.

In RStudio, you can create a new R script with this menu option:

```
File -> New File -> R Script
```

This will open a new pane in RStudio, like this:

<img src="img/rstudio_script.png">

The new pane is the scripts pane, which displays all of the R scripts you're
editing. Each script appears in a separate tab. In the screenshot, only one
script, the new script, is open.

Editing a script is similar to editing any other text document. You can write,
delete, copy, cut, and paste text. You can also save the file to your
computer's file system. When you do, pay attention to where you save the file,
as you might need it later.

The contents of an R script should be R code. Anything else you want to write
in the script (notes, documentation, etc.) should be in a _comment_. In R,
comments begin with `#` and extend to the end of the line:

```{r}
# This is a comment.
```

R will ignore comments when you run your code.

When you start a new project, it's a good idea to create a specific directory
for all of the project's files. If you're using R, you should also create one
or more R scripts in that directory. As you work, write your code directly into
a script. Arrange your code in the order of the steps to solve the problem,
even if you write some parts before others. Comment out or delete any lines of
code that you try but ultimately decide you don't need. Make sure to save the
file periodically so that you don't lose your work. Following these guidelines
will help you stay organized and make it easier to share your code with others
later.

While editing, you can run the current line in the R console by pressing
`Ctrl`+`Enter` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd`+`Enter` on macOS. This way you
can test and correct your code as you write it.

If you want, you can instead run (or _source_) the entire R script, by calling
the `source` function with the path to the script as an argument. This is also
what the "Source on Save" check box refers to in RStudio. The code runs in
order, only stopping if an error occurs.

For instance, if you save the script as `my_cool_script.R`, then you can run
`source("my_cool_script.R")` in the console to run the entire script (pay
attention to the path---it may be different on your computer).

R Markdown files are an alternative format for storing R code. They provide a
richer set of formatting options, and are usually a better choice than R
scripts if you're writing a report that contains code. You can learn more
about R Markdown files [here][rmd].

[rmd]: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/


### The Working Directory

Section \@ref(absolute-relative-paths) explained that relative paths have a
starting point that depends on the context where the path is used. We can make
that idea more concrete for R. The _working directory_ is the starting point R
uses for relative paths. Think of the working directory as the directory R is
currently "at" or watching.

The function `getwd` returns the absolute path for the current working
directory, as a string. It doesn't require any arguments:

```{r}
getwd()
```

On your computer, the output from `getwd` will likely be different. This is a
very useful function for getting your bearings when you write relative paths.
If you write a relative path and it doesn't work as expected, the first thing
to do is check the working directory.

The related `setwd` function changes the working directory. It takes one
argument: a path to the new working directory. Here's an example:

```{r}
setwd("..")

# Now check the working directory.
getwd()
```

Generally, you should avoid using calls to `setwd` in your R scripts and R
Markdown files. Calling `setwd` makes your code more difficult to understand,
and can always be avoided by using appropriate relative paths. If you call
`setwd` with an absolute path, it also makes your code less portable to other
computers. It's fine to use `setwd` interactively (in the R console), but avoid
making your saved code dependent on it.
 
Another function that's useful for dealing with the working directory and file
system is `list.files`. The `list.files` function returns the names of all of
the files and directories inside of a directory. It accepts a path to a
directory as an argument, or assumes the working directory if you don't pass a
path. For instance:

```{r}
# List files and directories in /home/.
list.files("/home/")

# List files and directories in the working directory.
list.files()
```

As usual, since you have a different computer, you're likely to see different
output if you run this code. If you call `list.files` with an invalid path or
an empty directory, the output is `character(0)`:

```{r}
list.files("/this/path/is/fake/")
```

Later on, we'll learn about what `character(0)` means more generally.


Reading Files
-------------

Analyzing data sets is one of the most common things to do in R. The first step
is to get R to read your data. Data sets come in a variety of file formats, and
you need to identify the format in order to tell R how to read the data.

Most of the time, you can guess the format of a file by looking at its
_extension_, the characters (usually three) after the last dot `.` in the
filename. For example, the extension `.jpg` or `.jpeg` indicates a [JPEG image
file][jpg]. Some operating systems hide extensions by default, but you can find
instructions to change this setting online by searching for "show file
extensions" and your operating system's name. The extension is just part of the
file's name, so it should be taken as a hint about the file's format rather
than a guarantee.

[jpg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG

R has built-in functions for reading a variety of formats. The R community also
provides _packages_, shareable and reusable pieces of code, to read even more
formats. You'll learn more about packages later, in Section \@ref(packages).
For now, let's focus on data sets that can be read with R's built-in functions.

Here are several formats that are frequently used to distribute data, along
with the name of a built-in function or contributed package that can read the
format:

| Name                        | Extension  | Function or Package  | Tabular?  | Text?
| :-------------------------- | :--------  | :------------------- | :-------- | :----
| Comma-separated Values      | `.csv`     | `read.csv`           | Yes       | Yes
| Tab-separated Values        | `.tsv`     | `read.delim`         | Yes       | Yes
| Fixed-width File            | `.fwf`     | `read.fwf`           | Yes       | Yes
| Microsoft Excel             | `.xlsx`    | **readr** package    | Yes       | No
| Microsoft Excel 1993-2007   | `.xls`     | **readr** package    | Yes       | No
| [Apache Arrow][arrow]       | `.feather` | **arrow** package    | Yes       | No
| R Data                      | `.rds`     | `readRDS`            | Sometimes | No
| R Data                      | `.rda`     | `load`               | Sometimes | No

A _tabular_ data set is one that's structured as a table, with rows and columns.
We'll focus on tabular data sets for most of this reader, since they're easier
to get started with. Here's an example of a tabular data set:

| Fruit  | Quantity | Price
| :----  | -------: | ----:
| apple  | 32       | 1.49
| banana | 541      | 0.79
| pear   | 10       | 1.99

A _text_ file is one that contains human-readable lines of text. You can check
this by opening the file with a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad or macOS
TextEdit. Many file formats use text in order to make the format easier to work
with.

For instance, a _comma-separated values_ (CSV) file records a tabular data
using one line per row, with commas separating columns. If you store the table
above in a CSV file and open the file in a text editor, here's what you'll see:

```
Fruit,Quantity,Price
apple,32,1.49
banana,541,0.79
pear,10,1.99
```

A _binary_ file is one that's not human-readable. You can't just read off the
data if you open a binary file in a text editor, but they have a number of
other advantages. Compared to text files, binary files are often faster to read
and take up less storage space (bytes).

As an example, R's built-in binary format is called _RDS_ (which may stand for
"R data serialized"). RDS files are extremely useful for backing up work, since
they can store any kind of R object, even ones that are not tabular. You can
learn more about how to create an RDS file on the `?saveRDS` help page, and how
to read one on the `?readRDS` help page.


### Hello, Data!

Let's read our first data set! Over the next few sections, we're going to
explore data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about median employee
earnings. The data set was prepared as part of the Tidy Tuesday R community
project. You can find more details about the data set [here][earn], and you can
download the data set [here][earn-dl] (you may need to choose `File -> Save
As...` in your browser's menu).

[earn]: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-02-23
[earn-dl]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-23/earn.csv

The data set is a file called `earn.csv`, which suggests it's a CSV file. In
this case, the extension is correct, so we can read the file into R with the
built-in `read.csv` function. The first argument is the path to where you saved
the file, which may be different on your computer. The `read.csv` function
returns the data set, but R won't keep the data in memory unless we assign the
returned result to a variable:

```{r}
earn = read.csv("data/earn.csv")
```

The variable name `earn` here is arbitrary; you can choose something different
if you want. However, in general, it's a good habit to choose variable names
that describe the contents of the variable somehow.

If you tried running the line of code above and got an error message, pay
attention to what the error message says, and remember the strategies to get
help in Section \@ref(getting-help). The most common mistake when reading a
file is incorrectly specifying the path, so first check that you got the path
right.

If you ran the line of code and there was no error message, congratulations,
you've read your first data set into R!


Data Frames
-----------

Now that we've loaded the data, let's take a look at it. When you're working
with a new data set, it's usually not a good idea to print it out directly (by
typing `earn`, in this case) until you know how big it is. Big data sets can
take a long time to print, and the output can be difficult to read.

Instead, you can use the `head` function to print only the beginning, or
_head_, of a data set. Let's take a peek:

```{r}
head(earn)
```

This data set is tabular---as you might have already guessed, since it came
from a CSV file. In R, it's represented by a _data frame_, a table with rows
and columns. R uses data frames to represent most (but not all) kinds of
tabular data. The `read.csv` function, which we used to read this data, always
returns a data frame.

For a data frame, the `head` function only prints the first six rows. If there
are lots of columns or the columns are wide, as is the case here, R wraps the
output across lines.

When you first read an object into R, you might not know whether it's a data
frame. One way to check is visually, by printing it, as we just did. A better
way to check is with the `class` function, which returns information about what
an object is. For a data frame, the result will always contain `data.frame`:

```{r}
class(earn)
```

We'll learn more about classes in Section \@ref(data-types-classes), but for
now you can use this function to identify data frames.

By counting the columns in the output from `head(earn)`, we can see that this
data set has eight columns. A more convenient way to check the number of
columns in a data set is with the `ncol` function:

```{r}
ncol(earn)
```

The similarly-named `nrow` function returns the number of rows:

```{r}
nrow(earn)
```

Alternatively, you can get both numbers at the same time with the `dim` (short
for "dimensions") function.

Since the columns have names, we might also want to get just these. You can do
that with the `names` or `colnames` functions. Both return the same result:

```{r}
names(earn)
colnames(earn)
```

If the rows have names, you can get those with the `rownames` function. For
this particular data set, the rows don't have names.

### Summarizing Data

An efficient way to get a sense of what's actually in a data set is to have R
compute summary information. This works especially well for data frames, but
also applies to other data. R provides two different functions to get
summaries: `str` and `summary`.

The `str` function returns a _structural summary_ of an object. This kind of
summary tells us about the structure of the data---the number of rows, the
number and names of columns, what kind of data is in each column, and some
sample values. Here's the structural summary for the earnings data:

```{r}
str(earn)
```

This summary lists information about each column, and includes most of what we
found earlier by using several different functions separately. The summary uses
`chr` to indicate columns of text ("characters") and `int` to indicate columns
of integers.

In contrast to `str`, the `summary` function returns a _statistical summary_ of
an object. This summary includes summary statistics for each column, choosing
appropriate statistics based on the kind of data in the column. For numbers,
this is generally the mean, median, and quantiles. For categories, this is the
frequencies. Other kinds of statistics are shown for other kinds of data.
Here's the statistical summary for the earnings data:

```{r}
summary(earn)
```

### Selecting Columns

You can select an individual column from a data frame by name with `$`, the
dollar sign operator. The syntax is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
VARIABLE$COLUMN_NAME
```
 
For instance, for the earnings data, `earn$age` selects
the `age` column, and `earn$n_persons` selects the `n_persons` column. So one
way to compute the mean of the `n_persons` column is:

```{r}
mean(earn$n_persons)
```

Similarly, to compute the range of the `year` column:

```{r}
range(earn$year)
```

You can also use the dollar sign operator to assign values to columns. For
instance, to assign `0` to the entire `quarter` column:

```{r}
earn$quarter = 0
```

Be careful when you do this, as there is no undo. Fortunately, we haven't
applied any transformations to the earnings data yet, so we can reset the
`earn` variable back to what it was by reloading the data set:

```{r}
earn = read.csv("data/earn.csv")
```

In Section \@ref(indexing), we'll learn how to select rows and individual
elements from a data frame, as well as other ways to select columns.

Vectors
-------

A _vector_ is a collection of values. Vectors are the fundamental unit of data
in R, and we've already used them in the previous sections.

For instance, each column in a data frame is a vector. So the `quarter` column
in the earnings data is a vector. Let's take a look at it. We can use `head`
again to avoid printing too much, this time specifying with the second argument
that we want to print exactly 10 values:

```{r}
head(earn$quarter, 10)
```

Like all vectors, this vector is ordered, which just means the values, or
_elements_, have specific positions. The value of the 1st element is `1`, the
2nd is `2`, the 5th is also `1`, and so on.

Notice that the elements of this vector are all integers. This isn't just a
quirk of the earnings data set. In R, the elements of a vector must all be the
same type of data (we say the elements are _homogeneous_). A vector can contain
integers, decimal numbers, strings, or several other types of data, but not a
mix these all at once.

The other columns in the earnings data frame are also vectors. For instance,
the `age` column is a vector of strings:

```{r}
head(earn$age)
```

Vectors can have any number of elements, including 0 or 1 element. Unlike
mathematics, R does not distinguish between vectors and _scalars_ (solitary
values). So as far as R is concerned, a solitary value, like `3`, is a vector
with 1 element.

You can check the length of a vector (and other objects) with the `length`
function:

```{r}
length(3)
length("hello")
length(earn$age)
```

Since the last of these is a column from the data frame `earn`, the length is
the same as the number of rows in `earn`.


### Creating Vectors

Sometimes you'll want to create your own vectors. You can do this by
concatenating several vectors together with the `c` function. It accepts any
number of vector arguments, and combines them into a single vector:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 19, -3)
c("hi", "hello")
c(1, 2, c(3, 4))
```

If the arguments you pass to the `c` function have different data types, R will
attempt to convert them to a common data type that preserves the information:

```{r}
c(1, "cool", 2.3)
```

The colon operator `:` creates vectors that contain sequences of integers. This
is useful for creating "toy" data to test things on, and later we'll see that
it's also important in several other contexts. Here are a few different
sequences:

```{r}
1:3
-3:5
10:1
```

Beware that both endpoints are included in the sequence, even in sequences like
`1:0`, and that the difference between elements is always `-1` or `1`. If you
want more control over the generated sequence, use the `seq` function instead.


### Indexing Vectors

You can access individual elements of a vector with the _indexing operator_ `[`
(also called the _square bracket operator_). The syntax is:

```
VECTOR[INDEXES]
```

Here `INDEXES` is a vector of positions of elements you want to get or set.

For example, let's make a vector with 5 elements and get the 2nd element:

```{r}
x = c(4, 8, 3, 2, 1)
x[2]
```

Now let's get the 3rd and 1st element:

```{r}
x[c(3, 1)]
```

You can use the indexing operator together with the assignment operator to
assign elements of a vector:

```{r}
x[3] = 0
x
```

Indexing is among the most frequently used operations in R, so take some time
to try it out with few different vectors and indexes. We'll revisit indexing in
Section \@ref(indexing) to learn a lot more about it.


### Vectorization

Let's look at what happens if we call a mathematical function, like `sin`, on a
vector:

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, 0, pi)
sin(x)
```

This gives us the same result as if we had called the function separately on
each element. That is, the result is the same as:

```{r}
c(sin(1), sin(3), sin(0), sin(pi))
```

Of course, the first version is much easier to type.

Functions that take a vector argument and get applied element-by-element like
this are said to be _vectorized_. Most functions in R are vectorized,
especially math functions. Some examples include `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`,
`exp`, and `sqrt`.

Functions that are not vectorized tend to be ones that combine or aggregate
values in some way. For instance, the `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `length`, and
`class` functions are not vectorized.

A function can be vectorized across multiple arguments. This is easiest to
understand in terms of the arithmetic operators. Let's see what happens if we
add two vectors together:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y = c(-1, 7, 10, -10)
x + y
```

The elements are paired up and added according to their positions. The other
arithmetic operators are also vectorized:

```{r}
x - y
x * y
x / y
```

### Recycling

When a function is vectorized across multiple arguments, what happens if the
vectors have different lengths? Whenever you think of a question like this as
you're learning R, the best way to find out is to create some toy data and test
it yourself. Let's try that now:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y = c(-1, 1)
x + y
```

The elements of the shorter vector are _recycled_ to match the length of the
longer vector. That is, after the second element, the elements of `y` are
repeated to make a vector with the same length as `x` (because `x` is longer),
and then vectorized addition is carried out as usual.

Here's what that looks like written down:

```
   1  2  3  4
+ -1  1 -1  1
  -----------
   0  3  2  5
```

If the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of the length of the
shorter vector, R issues a warning, but still returns the result. The warning
as meant as a reminder, because unintended recycling is a common source of
bugs:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y = c(-1, 1)
x + y
```

Recycling might seem strange at first, but it's convenient if you want to use a
specific value (or pattern of values) with a vector. For instance, suppose you
want to multiply all the elements of a vector by `2`. Recycling makes this
easy:

```{r}
2 * c(1, 2, 3)
```

When you use recycling, most of the time one of the arguments will be a scalar
like this.


### Making Comparisons

Comparisons are among the most common operations on vectors. The comparison
operators are:

* `<` for "less than"
* `>` for "greater than"
* `<=` for "less than or equal to"
* `>=` for "greater than or equal to"
* `==` for "equal to"
* `!=` for "not equal to"
* `%in%` for containment (explained below)

The "equal to" operator uses two equal signs so that R can distinguish it from
`=`, the assignment operator. Like the arithmetic operators, the comparison
operators are vectorized.

Let's look at a few examples with length-one vectors:

```{r}
1 < 3
"a" == "b"
3.1 == 3.1
```

When you make a comparison, R returns a _logical_ value, `TRUE` or `FALSE`, to
indicate the result. Logical values are different from strings, so they are not
quoted.

Logical values just like most other data types. You can use them in
computations, and you can create vectors of them. Here's some examples:

```{r}
TRUE
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
TRUE == FALSE
```

Now let's see what happens when we compare longer vectors:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3) < c(1, 3, -3)
c("he", "saw", "her") == c("she", "saw", "him")
```

Since the comparison operators are all vectorized, the elements of the vectors
are compared element-by-element, and R returns a logical value for each pair.

What if you want to test whether all the elements in a vector are equal (or
unequal)? There are several ways to do this. One is to use the `all` function
on the result of the comparison. The `all` function takes a vector of logical
values and returns `TRUE` if all of them are `TRUE`, and returns `FALSE`
otherwise:

```{r}
all(c(1, 2, 3) < c(1, 3, -3))
```

The related `any` function returns `TRUE` if any one element is `TRUE`, and
returns `FALSE` otherwise:

```{r}
any(c("hi", "hello") == c("hi", "bye"))
```

There are two more ways to test whether objects are equal:

1. The `all.equal` function tests whether objects are equal up to some
   acceptable difference called the _tolerance_. You should generally use
   `all.equal` rather than `==` to compare decimal numbers. Computer
   representations for decimal numbers are inherently imprecise, so comparison
   using a (small) tolerance is often necessary.

2. The `identical` function checks whether objects are completely identical,
   including their metadata (names, dimensions, and so on). Use this to compare
   non-vector objects such as data frames. This function also works for
   vectors, but most of the time `==` is sufficient.

Another common comparison is to check whether elements of one vector are
contained in another vector at any position. For instance, suppose you want to
check whether `1` or `2` appear anywhere in a longer vector `x`. Here's how to
do it:

```{r}
x = c(3, 4, 2, 7, 3, 7)
c(1, 2) %in% x
```

R returns `FALSE` for the `1` because there's no `1` in `x`, and returns `TRUE`
for the `2` because there is a `2` in `x`.

Notice that this is different from comparing with `==`. If we use `==`, the
shorter vector is recycled until its length matches the longer one, and then
compared element-by-element. For the example, this means only the elements at
odd-numbered positions are compared to `1`, and only the elements at
even-numbered positions are compared to `2`:

```{r}
c(1, 2) == x
```

Finally, new programmers sometimes incorrectly think they need to append `==
TRUE` to their comparisons. This is redundant, makes your code harder to
understand, and wastes computational time. Comparisons already return logical
values. If the result of the comparison is `TRUE`, then `TRUE == TRUE` is again
just `TRUE`. If the result is `FALSE`, then `FALSE == TRUE` is again just
`FALSE`. Likewise, if you want to invert a condition, choose an appropriate
operator rather than appending `== FALSE`.
