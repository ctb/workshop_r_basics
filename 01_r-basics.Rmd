Getting Started
===============

R is a program for statistical computing. It provides a rich set of built-in
tools for cleaning, exploring, modeling, and visualizing data.

The main way you'll interact with R is by writing code or _expressions_ in the
R programming language. Most people use "R" as a blanket term to refer to both
the program and the programming language. Usually, the distinction doesn't
matter, but in cases where it does, we'll point it out and be specific.

By writing code, you create an unambiguous record of every step taken in an
analysis. This it one of the major advantages of R (and other programming
languages) over point-and-click software like Tableau and Microsoft Excel.
Code you write in R is *reproducible*: you can share it with someone else, and
if they run it with the same inputs, they'll get the same results.

Another advantage of writing code is that it's often *reusable*. This can mean
automating a repetitive task within a single analysis, recycling code from one
analysis into another, or _packaging_ useful code for distribution to the
general public. At the time of writing, there were over 17,000 user-contributed
packages available for R, spanning a broad range of disciplines.

R is one of many programming languages used in data science. Compared to other
programming languages, R's particular strengths are its interactivity, built-in
support for handling missing data, the ease with which you can produce
high-quality data visualizations, and its broad base of user-contributed
packages (due to both its age and growing popularity).


Prerequisites
-------------

You can download R for free [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/), and can find
an install guide [here]().

In addition to R, you'll need RStudio. RStudio is an *integrated development
environment* (IDE), which means it's a comprehensive program for writing,
editing, searching, and running code. You can do all of these things without
RStudio, but RStudio makes the process easier. You can download RStudio Desktop
Open-Source Edition for free
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and can find an
install guide [here]().


The R Interface
---------------

The first time you open RStudio, you'll see a window divided into several
panes, like this:

<img src="img/rstudio_start.png">

Don't worry if the text in the panes isn't exactly the same on your computer;
it depends on your operating system and versions of R and RStudio. The console
pane, on the left, is the main interface to R. If you type R code into the
console and press the `Enter` key on your keyboard, R will run your code and
return the result.

On the right are the environment pane and the plots pane. The environment pane
shows data in your R workspace. The plots pane shows any plots you make, and
also has tabs to browse your file system and to view R's built-in help files.
We'll learn more about these gradually, but to get started we'll focus on the
console pane.

Let's start by using R to do some arithmetic. In the console, you'll see that
the cursor is on a line that begins with `>`, called the *prompt*. You can make
R compute the sum $2 + 2$ by typing the code `2 + 2` after the prompt and then
pressing the `Enter` key. Your code and the result from R should look like
this:

<img src="img/arithmetic.png">

R always puts the result on a separate line (or lines) from your code. In this
case, the result begins with the tag `[1]`, which is a hint from R that the
result is a *vector* and that this line starts with the *element* at position 1.
We'll learn more about vectors in Section \@ref(vectors), and eventually learn
about other data types that are displayed differently. The result of the sum,
`4`, is displayed after the tag. In this reader, results from R will usually be
typeset in monospace and further prefixed with `##` to indicate that they
aren't code.

If you enter an incomplete expression, R will change the prompt to `+`, then
wait for you to type the rest of the expression and press the `Enter` key.
Here's what it looks like if you only enter `2 +`:

<img src="img/incomplete.png">

You can finish entering the expression, or you can cancel it by pressing the
`Esc` key (or `Ctrl-c` if you're using R without RStudio). R can only tell an
expression is incomplete if it's missing something, like the second operand in
`2 +`. So if you mean to enter `2 + 2` but accidentally enter `2`, which is a
complete expression by itself, don't expect R to read your mind and wait for
more input!

Try out some other arithmetic in the R console. Besides `+` for addition, the
other arithmetic operators are:

* `-` for subtraction
* `*` for multiplication
* `/` for division
* `%%` for remainder division (modulo)
* `^` or `**` for exponentiation

You can combine these and use parentheses to make more complicated expressions,
just as you would when writing a mathematical expression. When R computes a
result, it follows the standard order of operations: parentheses,
exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, and finally subtraction.
For example, to estimate the area of a circle with radius 3, you can write:

```{r}
3.14 * 3^2
```

You can write R expressions with any number of spaces (including none) around
the operators and R will still compute the result. Nevertheless, putting spaces
in your code makes it easier for you and others to read, so it's good to make
it a habit. Put spaces around most operators, after commas, and after keywords.

### Variables

Since R is designed for mathematics and statistics, you might expect that it
provides a better appoximation for $\pi$ than `3.14`. R and most other
programming languages allow you to create named values, or _variables_. R
provides a built-in variable called `pi` for the value of $\pi$. You can
display a variable's value by entering its name in the console:

```{r}
pi
```

You can also use variables in expressions. For instance, here's a more precise
expression for the area of a circle with radius 3:

```{r}
pi * 3^2
```

You can define your own variables with the assignment operator `=` or `<-`. In
most circumstances these two operators are interchangeable. For clarity, it's
best to choose one you like and use it consistently in all of your R code. In
this reader, we use `=` for assignment because this is the assignment operator
in most programming languages.

The main reason to use variables is to save results so that you can use them
on other expressions later. For example, to save the area of the circle in a
variable called `area`, we can write:

```{r}
area = pi * 3^2
```

In R, variable names can contain any combination of letters, numbers, dots `.`,
and underscores `_`, but must always start with a letter or a dot. Spaces and
other symbols are not allowed in variable names.

Now we can use the `area` variable anywhere we want the computed area. Notice
that when you assign a result to a variable, R doesn't automatically display
that result. If you want to see the result as well, you have to enter the
variable's name as a separate expression:

```{r}
area
```

Another reason to use variables is to make an expression more general. For
instance, you might want to compute the area of several circles with different
radii. Then the expression `pi * 3^2` is too specific. You can rewrite it as
`pi * r^2`, and then assign a value to the variable `r` just before you compute
the area. Here's the code to compute and display the area of a circle with
radius 1 this way:

```{r}
r = 1
area = pi * r^2
area
```

Now if you want to compute the area for a different radius, all you have to do
is change `r` and run the code again (R will not change `area` until you do
this). Writing code that's general enough to reuse across multiple problems can
be a big time-saver in the long run. Later on, we'll see ways to make this code
even easier to reuse.

### Calling Functions

R can do a lot more than just arithmetic. Most of R's features are provided
through _functions_, pieces of reusable code. You can think of a function as a
machine that takes some inputs and uses them to produce some output. In
programming jargon, the inputs to a function are called _arguments_, the output
is called the _return value_, and when we use a function, we say we're
_calling_ the function.

To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses. Put any arguments
to the function inside the parentheses. For example, in R, the sine function is
named `sin` (there are also `cos` and `tan`). So we can compute the sine of
$\pi / 4$ with this code:

```{r}
sin(pi / 4)
```

There are many functions that accept more than one argument. For instance, the
`sum` function accepts any number of arguments and adds them all together. When
you call a function with multiple arguments, separate the arguments with
commas. So another way to compute $2 + 2$ in R is:

```{r}
sum(2, 2)
```

When you call a function, R assigns each argument to a _parameter_. Parameters
are special variables that represent the inputs to a function and only exist
while that function runs. For example, the `log` function, which computes a
logarithm, has parameters `x` and `base` for the operand and base of the
logaritm, respectively. The next section, Section \@ref(getting-help), explains
how to look up the parameters for a function.

By default, R assigns arguments to parameters based on their order. The first
argument is assigned to the function's first parameter, the second to the
second, and so on. So we can compute the logarithm of 64, base 2, with this
code:

```{r}
log(64, 2)
```

The argument 64 is assigned to the parameter `x`, and the argument 2 is
assigned to the parameter `base`. You can also assign arguments to parameters
by name with `=` (not `<-`), overriding their positions. So some other ways we
could write the call above are:

```{r}
log(64, base = 2)
log(x = 64, base = 2)
log(base = 2, x = 64)
log(base = 2, 64)
```

All of these are equivalent. When you write code, choose whatever seems the
clearest to you. Leaving parameter names out of calls saves typing, but
including some or all of them can make the code easier to understand.

Parameters are not regular variables, and only exist while their associated
function runs. You can't set them before a call, nor can you access them after
a call. So this code causes an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x = 64
log(base = 2)
```

In the error message, R says that we forgot to assign an argument to the
parameter `x`. We can keep the variable `x` and correct the call by making `x`
an argument (for the parameter `x`):

```{r}
log(x, base = 2)
```

Or, written more explicitly:

```{r}
log(x = x, base = 2)
```

In summary, variables and parameters are distinct, even if they happen to have
the same name. The variable `x` is not the same thing as the parameter `x`.


Getting Help
------------

Learning and using a language is hard, so it's important to know how to get
help. The first place to look for help is R's built-in documentation. In the
console, you can access a specific help page by name with `?` followed by the
name of the page.

There are help pages for all of R's built-in functions, usually with the same
name as the function itself. So the code to open the help page for the `log`
function is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log
```

For functions, help pages usually include a brief description, a list of
parameters, a description of the return value, and some examples.

There are also help pages for other topics, such as built-in mathematical
constants (such as `?pi`), data sets (such as `?iris`), and operators. To look
up the help page for an operator, put the operator's name in single or double
quotes. For example, this code opens the help page for the arithmetic
operators:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?"+"
```

It's always okay to put quotes around the name of the page when you use `?`,
but they're only required if it contains non-alphabetic characters. So `?sqrt`,
`?'sqrt'`, and `?"sqrt"` all open the documentation for `sqrt`, the square root
function.

R treats anything inside single or double quotes as literal text rather than as
an expression to evaluate. In programming jargon, a piece of literal text is
called a _string_. You can use whichever kind of quotes you prefer, but the
quote at the beginning of the string must match the quote at the end. 

Sometimes you might not know the name of the help page you want to look up. You
can do a general search of R's help pages with `??` followed by a string of
search terms. For example, to get a list of all help pages related to linear
models:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
??"linear model"
```

This search function doesn't always work well, and it's often more efficient to
use an online search engine. When you search for help with R online, include
"R" as a search term. Alternatively, you can use [RSeek][rseek], which
restricts the search to a selection of R-related websites.

### What to Do When Something Goes Wrong

As a programmer, sooner or later you'll run some code and get an error message
or result you didn't expect. Don't panic! Even experienced programmers make
mistakes regularly, so learning how to diagnose and fix problems is vital.

Try going through these steps:

1. If R returned a warning or error message, read it! If you're not sure what
   the message means, try searching for it online.
2. Check your code for typographical errors, including incorrect capitalization
   and missing or extra commas, quotes, and parentheses.
3. Test your code one line at a time, starting from the beginning. After each
   line that assigns a variable, check that the value of the variable is what
   you expect. Try to determine the exact line where the problem originates
   (which may differ from the line that emits an error!).

If none of these steps help, try asking online. [Stack Overflow][stacko] is a
popular question and answer website for programmers. Before posting, make sure
to read about [how to ask a good question][goodq].
